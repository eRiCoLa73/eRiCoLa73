**eRiCoLa73/eRiCoLa73** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

I am a self taught tech newbie and I have no intention of stopping. I honestly am looking to change careers to provide for my family and leave everyone who said I couldn't in the dust. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on IBM DATA WAREHOUSE ENGINEER PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to create Data Pipelines to extract, transform and load data repositories using shell scripts, and tools such as Apache Airflow & Kafka; to Deploy, Manage, Secure, Operationalize, Monitor and Optimize relational database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and DB2; to Design and populate Data Warehouses and analyze their data with Business Intelligence (BI) tools like Cognos Analytics 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding a remote position. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I used to be a nun and didn't even have an email.
